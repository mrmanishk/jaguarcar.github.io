<h2 style="color: blue">History Of Jaguar</h2> 
<p>On 1 January 2013, the group, which had been operating as two separate companies underwent a fundamental restructuring. The parent company was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC, while the Jaguar Cars Limited was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the assets of Land Rover were transferred to it. This ensured that Jaguar Land Rover Limited was responsible in the UK for the design, production and marketing of both Jaguar and Land Rover products.
